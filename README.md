# Gradient Atmospheric model

MATLAB code for calculating radiative cooling performance using a gradient atmospheric model.

This code supports the analysis presented in our paper:

Y. Jin and M. Kats, "A gradient atmospheric model reveals enhanced radiative cooling potential and demonstrates the advantages of broadband emitters,"
Laser & Photonics Reviews (2025).

## How to run.

1. Download all files (4 txt files, 1 .mat file, 2 .m files) in the same folder.
2. Open "Gradient_atmospheric_model_for_public.m" in MATLAB.
3. Set parameters according to the instructions in the .m file.
4. Run.
